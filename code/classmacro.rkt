This module introduces the following additional class options:
* specifying a list of superclasses
* defining a method combination

    (class (first second ...)
        ...
        (define/generic (methodname args...) combination)
        ...
    )

The superclass specifier can be either a single class (as in standard Object Racket) or an unquoted, possibly empty list of classes.

The combination can be any operator that can be applied to a list of arguments, e.g. +, list, append.

-----------------------------------------------------

This module is a prototype for extending the class macro for multiple inheritance without touching the underlying implementation of Racket's object system.

As long as only single inheritance is used there should be no noticable difference between using this module and not using it. When the macro is used with multiple superclasse, the class will inherit fields and methods from all superclasses depending on the precedence of the classes or the specified combination. The result is a normal Racket object. The actual superclass will be object% and the code of all inherited fields and methods will be injected into the class macro by hand. 

The implementation uses a metaobject protocol (MOP) that loosely follows "The Art of of the Metaobject Protocol" (AMOP) by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des RiviÃ¨res and Daniel G. Bobrow. Instead of defining an own hidden layer, it uses the existing Racket object system as basis though: Whenever a Racket class is created, we'll keep track of it and store some additional info about it in form of a(nother) Racket object that we call meta-object. The meta-object keeps track of everything that we won't be (easily) able to ask the class after creation. The class that defines those meta-objects is consequently called meta-class. 

This module was created by Manuela Beckert as master thesis project. The corresponding (German) thesis is titled "Untersuchungen zur Integration von CLOS-Konzepten in das Objektsystem von Racket" and will be accessible at the library in the computer science department of the University of Hamburg, Germany.

; provide new version of the class macro
(provide (rename-out [my-class class]))

; redefine class macro.
; Instead of only a single superclass, this macro allows
; to also specify a (possibly empty) list of superclasses.
; Thus, there are three cases: That we got
; * a single class
; * an empty list (we'll treat this as object%)
; * a non-empty list

; * classes with multiple suplerclasses will be put together
;   here; they will have object% as "official" superclass
;   because we'll do all the inheritance work already and
;   Object Racket shall not do it again
; * information that we'll need later about the class object
;   will be stored in a meta object
